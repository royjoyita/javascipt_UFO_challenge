# javascipt_UFO_challenge

Created a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file.

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, written a code that appends to a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

I have put column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Used a date form in my HTML document and written my JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
